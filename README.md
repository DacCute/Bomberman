<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Introduction
This is our Bomberman project for the Object-Oriented Programming course at HCMIU in semester 2 (2022-2023). It's a classic arcade-style video game that was first released in 1983. In the game, players control a character called Bomberman who navigates through a maze-like environment, using bombs to destroy obstacles and enemies in order to progress to the next level.

We hope you enjoy it!

<!-- ABOUT THE GAME -->
## About the Game
The aim of Bomberman is to strategically plant bombs to eliminate obstacles and opponents while avoiding getting caught in the blast. The ultimate goal is to progress through levels, defeat the boss, and become the last player standing. The game requires quick thinking, problem-solving skills, and strategic planning to succeed.
